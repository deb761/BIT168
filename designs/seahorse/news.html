	<h2>Beer Dive Report</h2>
    <h3>posted Jul 25, 2015, 5:36 PM by Ed Gullekson</h3>
    <p>The annual Beer Dive at Edmonds UW Park was this last Thursday. Brian Heath runs these summer outdoor events and always does a great job of placing the beer &amp; soft drink markers. Plus he is the chef for the evening after the dive. Seven divers showed up to chase beer on the bottom. What also showed up was a north breeze, enough to put up a 1 foot chop. And you know what that means at shallow Edmonds - reduced visibility - yup 3 to 5 feet (I am being generous). Well, we d...ivers left 9 beers out there. So if you want go back and find them. At the end of the dive, the wind dropped and it got real nice, but we were done diving and munched a talked. Thanks to Brian and to all who enjoyed the evening with us - George Dive Meister, Randy Pedersen, Byron Kim, David Wakeley, Pieter Booth, and Dan Davis. Next month is the Wine Dive at Alki Pipeline on 8/27.</p>
