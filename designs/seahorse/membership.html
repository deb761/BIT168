Our goal is to help you get out and dive more often, and enjoy it more. To do that, we sponsor local dives, monthly meetings and programs, social events, and dive excursions to exciting locations both in the region (B.C., Neah Bay, San Juan Islands) and further away, such as our regular escape to Cozumel.</p>
